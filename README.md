#                         bookmarklets
this is a place to store different dumb/useful bookmarklets I have made

##                      The Text Editor
this is a text editor I made to somewhat replace the inspect element, it 
includes a toggle button, and a turn off button, with more features maybe 
                            to come.
                            
##                        The RickRoll
This is a bookmarklet that converts the first 69(not intentional, 
I was just too lazy to add more lines) links in a website to lead 
                         to a rickroll.
                         
##                          No Mouse 
this gets rid of your mouse, you have to press esc to get your mouse back.
